                                "3D printing is likely a process in which a three-dimensional object is formed of material joined or solidified under the control of computer technology. Invented a couple of decades ago, this type of printing does not show much difference from a normal printer in operation. A 3D printer generates a much thinner layer of ink and forming an object printed takes much more time, though. Another distinct feature is the materials utilized which range from inexpensive plastic, wax, resin to pricey titan or gold. Thanks to a special software called CAD (computer aided design), the printing process takes place building up layers of the substances, similarly to the one conducted with ink.",

                                "Back to the old days, initial additive manufacturing equipment and materials were developed in the 1980s. The first year welcomed Hideo Kodama’s invention of two additive methods for manufacturing three-dimensional plastic models with photo-hardening thermoset polymer. In 1984, Alain Le Méhauté, Olivier de Witte, and Jean Claude André introduced the stereolithography process, which was however rejected by the French General Electric Company and the Laser Consortium as they did not see any commercial prospect applying this to production. Three weeks later, Chuck Hull coming from 3D Systems Corporation obtained patent for stereolithography fabrication system, in which layers are added by curing photopolymers with ultraviolet light lasers. It was in 1988 when the technology used by most 3D printers to date, namely fused deposition modeling, was innovated. This special application of plastic extrusion was first developed by S. Scott Crump and then commercialized by his company Stratasys in early 1990s.",

The modern printed models created with CAD result in reduced errors and can be corrected before printing, allowing verification in the design of the object before it is printed. The manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to plastic arts such as sculpting. 3D scanning is a process of collecting digital data on the shape and appearance of a real object, creating a digital model based on it. Currently, 3D printing has been used in manufacturing, medical, industry and sociocultural sectors which facilitate 3D printing to become successful commercial technology.",
